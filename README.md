A UI protoytpe for a virtual travel assistant web application developed with React. Wander is a research driven project that began in the interview stage where a dozen people were asked about their likes and dislikes in the booking travel area. After the user stories were created, collegues and I conducted a brainstormming session. Many ideas were discussed ultimately leading to a well-developed solution. A low-fidelity desgin was created using Figma. Once feedback was received by initial intervieews and collegues, the high-fidelity prototype was created leaving all content. In my project labeled Wander-Travel-App a fullstack application was built in Java using this same idea.
